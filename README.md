WhatsCooking
A cooking website where you can save cooking recipes using vanilla JS, EJS, Node, and MongoDB.

You can post, view, and review recipes. I made this project because I like to cook, but trying to find which cook book has the recipe I'm looking for is a problem. Now I just add those recipe to WhatsCooking so I don't have to remember where each recipe is.
